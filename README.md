# Cool_Dice_game_JS

Hola Folks👨‍💻,
This is a cool and very interesting two-player dice game.
One to reach 100 points wins the game 🥳, but here is the cache if
You are player 1, for example, and you keep rolling your dice.
score will get updated as you keep rolling, but the moment you roll
1 on the die, then you lose the updated points, and player 2 gets the
chance So, to avoid this, you can hold your points whenever you feel
comfortable 💪, then player 2 willget a chance.e

So, basically, this mini-project demonstrates the use of functions, arrays,
Math library, swithes, loops, and basic selectors and listeners basics
and events listener in JS.

thank you😇!
